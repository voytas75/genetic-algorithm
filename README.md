This is a genetic algorithm written in Powershell. I decided to write it for two reasons. The first reason was to learn what a genetic algorithm is, the second reason was to gain experience in Powershell. The implementation of this algorithm is not difficult, but requires understanding what GA is and how it works.

Using the script is very simple. First you need to run the script:
```
. .\start-genalog.ps1
```
The first period allows you to load functions from a file into the current scope.
Then the genetic algorithm can be run:

```
Start-GA
```
